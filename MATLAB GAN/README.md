The goal of this project is to train a Generative Adversarial Network that is capable of generating flower images.

The generator and discriminator used in this project are based on [this](https://www.mathworks.com/help/deeplearning/ug/train-generative-adversarial-network.html) article and [this](https://www.tensorflow.org/datasets/catalog/tf_flowers) dataset was used to train the model.

This notebook does use TensorBoard to illustrate model information.

To use this notebook simply open MATLAB_FlowerGAN.ipynb and follow the instructions.

**IMPORTANT:
It is notable that this project resulted in failure and was not able to produce the desired outputs.**
